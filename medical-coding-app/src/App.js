        INITIAL SUBJECTIVE
        9/22/22: The patient initially reports being a hair stylist. She states she’s had R carpal tunnel for “years”. She states the first time she noticed the carpal tunnel was 12 years ago when she was packing/moving. Her arm was going numb so she saw her MD and was dx with carpal tunnel. She has done a lot to manage the carpal tunnel. She has done exercises and changed her posture. The carpal tunnel hasn’t been very problematic over the past 2 years. She wants to be able to build upper body strength, but everything she tries to do causes shoulder pain and UE N/T. She has been trying to do push-ups and cycling and that causes soreness and numbness. However, she states over the past 2 months she has been biking more and “new, disruptive things” are happening in the L arm now. She c/o pain with raising her arm over her head as well as putting pressure on her wrist. She went on a 200 mi cycling trip in September and the first day was fine, but the second day she felt she put a lot of weight on her arms and she felt N/T in the last 2 fingers of the L arm when she finished. She states the fingers stayed numb for “ages.” She bought padded bike gloves. She states she can tell hands/fingers are in a “fragile state.” She can feel it when she has her arms up to dry hair at work. She is riding a hybrid bike. She splits her time between SF and Virginia and has a similar bike in both areas. She feels the L shoulder pain when she raises her shoulder. The longer she has her arm over her hand, then her hand will be “angry the rest of the day” (ie changing a lightbulb). She denies waking up with N/T in her hands. Patient is R hand dominant
        
        PMH: Patient notes “lifelong back pain”, she started a hip stretching program recently and hasn’t had pain since then

        Rx: Patient gave consent to treat
        - HEP including: LAX pecs, shdr blades, UTs; foam roller UE; ulnar nerve glide
        
        ASSESSMENT
        The patient presents in therapy with signs and symptoms consistent with ULNT in the ulnar distribution as well as possible L shoulder/RC irritation from performing repetitive movements being a hair stylist. Patient would benefit from further therapy to address limitations in cervical ROM, postural strength, soft tissue release in pecs/UE, and postural re-education (mid-back, core/hips, hip flexor stretching, pelvic tilting). Patient had no adverse reactions to treatment. HEP was issued.
        
        GOALS
        “To learn how to clam the inflammation of the nerves as well as build upper body strength without making things worse.”
        
        PLAN
        Plan to see patient in 2 weeks to progress treatment.

        INITIAL SUBJECTIVE
        10/3/22: The patient initially reports seeing 2 PTs in the past year for a wrist issue. Both PTs felt it was shoulder related as she is a hair stylist. She has cubital tunnel syndrome, which only bothers her at night. She wears braces at night, which seems to eliminate her N/T. She states the N/T does wake her at night. She also has an elbow brace that keeps her elbow straight at night, but sometimes she takes that off. She notices R hand N/T in the last 2 fingers. She knows she sleeps with her arms/hands curled up. She was given lat exercises, but she still has pain in the heel of her R hand. She is unable to bear weight through the R hand. She feels her ROM is limited and it causes pain. Pushing and pulling motion hurt it. If she tries to do a chest press, it can cause pain for a few days. 
        
        She hasn’t had a nerve conduction study, but she has had a wrist/elbow X-ray which was unremarkable. She denies any imaging on the neck. 
        
        PMH: She was in a car accident 2 years ago. She states she was driving and colliding with another car that was turning out of an alley. Her car was hit on the passenger side. 10 years ago, also had a MVA and was rear-ended at a stoplight. She can’t remember if her airbag deployed. She states she didn’t lose consciousness. She has seen 2 “hand/wrist” doctors and they felt it was muscular vs neurologic. 
        
        Pain Ratings

        Red Flags: N/T, had some weakness with first in-person PT sessions, but improved with lat exercises
        
        OBJECTIVE
        Observation: The patient presents in therapy with a forward head and shoulders posture, R pec tighter than L pec
        
        Palpation: Self-palpation reveals R UT TTP, R elbow extensor mass, triceps
        
        Cervical ROM
        - Flex/Ext: WNL / WNL
        - RSB/LSB: 25% limited (“tight”)

        MMT/Strength: Patient notes grip is grossly equal

        ULNT: R ulnar is “really tight” compared to L, but not N/T; median N is present with B hands, R > L

        - HEP including: lacrosse ball to UT, pecs, scaps, forearms; ulnar and median nerve glides
        
        ASSESSMENT
        The patient presents in therapy with signs and symptoms consistent with ulnar nerve pathology due to positive neural tension testing in addition to poor posture and a job that requires repetitive movements. Patient would benefit from further therapy to address limitations in cervical and wrist ROM, UE/postural strengthening, soft tissue release in neck, shoulders and upper back, and postural re-education. Patient had no adverse reactions to treatment. HEP was issued via our platform.
        
        GOALS
        To be symptom-free with her job, at night and to be able to weight-bear through the UEs.

        INITIAL SUBJECTIVE
        11/9/22: The patient initially reports an insidious onset of L anterior hip pain since March, 2022. She states she was bouldering and she doesn’t remember anything crazy during, but afterwards she had alot of pain afterwards and even had trouble walking. She was resting after that and started to do some banded strengthening exercises for her hips and gluts. Running, climbing and certain moves that require a higher foot placement (like hiking/backpacking) also bother it. Rest makes it feel better. The pain starts in the front of the L hip and can sometimes “wrap around” to the side of the hip. H/o R PFP and a tailbone injury most recently. She has been doing her old PT exercises.
        
        SLEEP: in general 8 hr sleeper, good sleep hygiene
        NUTRITION: “pretty good”, gets good macros, veggies, protein, but has a sweet tooth
        EXERCISE: See above
        STRESS: Has a new job and partner, so having some transitional stress, but she feels she is doing ok, goes to therapy and meditates
